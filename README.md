## How It Works

1. JavaScript uses the `Date` object to get the current hours, minutes, and seconds.  
2. Converts 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM.  
3. Adds leading zeros to single-digit hours, minutes, or seconds.  
4. Updates the content of the clock every second using `setTimeout`.  
5. CSS styles the clock for a clean, modern appearance.
